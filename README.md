# tf2-trading-script
This project started as a simple script that analyzed a single page of listings from backpack.tf to figure out which ones were profitable, but expanded to search multiple pages and filter out content that didnâ€™t match a given price threshold, displaying only listings considered profitable in the results.

Currently the CSS for the output is a little dated since the html on backpack.tf's site changed recently.

# Useage
To run the script, simply install node.js and run npm install in the project directory to install dependencies. Then run `node fetch-deals.js` to execute the script.
